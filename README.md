Python dependency management


## Assumptions 
1. Server has direct access to internet
2. pipenv is anlreay installed
    Please run the following command if pipenv is not already installed 
    ## sudo yum install pipenv
3. Considering the dependent packages have egg (or wheel) file
4. The structure was created to keep all the packages in one repository. Although, this is not a requirement. I chose this structure to simplify and colocate the code files
